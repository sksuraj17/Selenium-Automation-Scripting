# Selenium-Automation-Scripting

Hello people,
I've completed my Selenium Automation Scripting task (TASK 6) as a Web Development Intern under GRADUATE ROTATIONAL INTERNSHIP PROGRAM (i.e) GRIP by the Sparks Foundation.
In this project I used Selenium to create a test case to test the website thesparksfoundation.sg.

My task is to,

 ◇ Read up about Testing. 

 ◇ Learn selenium and basic selenium automation scripting.

 ◇ Start with Google Search and read tutorials. Watch videos to 
 learn about various aspects of testing using selenium.

 ◇ Use selenium to create a test case to test the website 
 thesparksfoundation.sg 

 ◇ The test script should check of at least 5 pages and 10 
 elements in total. 

 ◇ Each element could be e.g. if the Logo exists, the navigation 
 bar appears, the name on about us page is correct, etc.
